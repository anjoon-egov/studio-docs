# Value Proposition

Government digital platforms often suffer from fragmented development efforts, leading to:

* 🚧 Inconsistent implementations across similar services
* 🔁 Duplication of UI and logic, increasing maintenance overhead
* 🔄 Limited reusability of components and features

The **Digit Solution Framework** addresses these challenges by offering:

* ✅ A shared service layer to standardise logic and reduce redundancy
* ⚙️ Configurable, modular UI components to support rapid customisation
* 🛠️ A centralised management console for easier administration and control
