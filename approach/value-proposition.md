# Value Proposition

Government digital platforms often suffer from fragmented development efforts, leading to:

* 🚧 Inconsistent implementations across similar services
* 🔁 Duplication of UI and logic, increasing maintenance overhead
* 🔄 Limited reusability of components and features

The **DIGIT Solution Framework** addresses these challenges by offering:

* ✅ A shared service layer to standardise logic and reduce redundancy
* ⚙️ Configurable, modular UI components to support rapid customisation
* 🛠️ A centralised management console for easier administration and control

### **Goals - DIGIT Studio**

* **Accelerated Use Case Development**
  * Enable faster development of services like **Licenses & Permits** and **Grievance Redressal** by offering prebuilt, adaptable templates.
  * Reduce the need to build entire workflows or UIs from scratch.
* **Simplified Configuration**
  * Streamline adjustments to:
    * **Form fields**
    * **Workflows**
    * **User roles and permissions**
    * **Master data**
  * Make these elements **declarative and schema-driven**, reducing the time and expertise needed for changes.
* **Lower Maintenance Overhead**
  * Leverage reusable, standardised components that reduce redundancy.
  * Centralised configuration improves maintainability and traceability.

### **Key Features**

* **Configurable Workflows** using YAML or JSON.
* **Metadata-driven Form UIs**, automatically rendered from schema.
* **Role-based Access and Permissions Management** through centralized config.
* **Master Data Management Integration**, making domain-specific updates easier.
* **Domain-agnostic UI/UX Components**, enabling rapid reuse across verticals.
