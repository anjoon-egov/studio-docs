# Design Approach

## DIGIT Studio - An Overview

DIGIT Studio is a no-code configuration platform that empowers eGov partners and SI teams to quickly build, customise, and deploy DIGIT-based services without writing code or relying on engineering backlogs.

The solution seeks to enable SI teams and partners to launch faster, scale configurations confidently across geographies, and reduce their engineering dependency — all within the compliance and guardrails of DIGIT.

## Pain Points Addressed

* Repetitive work across implementations (copy-pasting configs, workflows)
* Delays due to reliance on engineering teams for simple changes
* Non-reusable service setup across modules and states
* No clear way to demo changes quickly to stakeholders

## Audience&#x20;

Role: Partner Project Manager / SI Solution Architect / Lead developers

Organisation: eGov partner

Responsibilities: Lead deployment of DIGIT-based modules across multiple ULBs or states

Digital: Fluent with configuration platforms, form engines, low-code tools, Git, Jira

## Phase 1 Outputs

The near-term vision for DIGIT Studio (earlier called Solution Framework) is a low-code accelerator on DIGIT 2.9 LTS that enables rapid deployment of configurable apps, helping eGov partners quickly launch systems.

We’re piloting DIGIT Studio with the Local Business License Issuing System, making licensing workflow deployment faster.
