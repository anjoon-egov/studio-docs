# Design Approach

## DIGIT Studio - An Overview

DIGIT Studio is a no-code configuration platform that empowers eGov partners and SI teams to quickly build, customise, and deploy DIGIT-based services without writing code or relying on engineering backlogs.

The solution seeks to enable SI teams and partners to launch faster, scale configurations confidently across geographies, and reduce their engineering dependency—all within DIGIT's compliance and guardrails.

## Pain Points Addressed

* Repetitive work across implementations (copy-pasting configs, workflows)
* Delays due to reliance on engineering teams for simple changes
* Non-reusable service setup across modules and states
* No clear way to demo changes quickly to stakeholders

## Audience&#x20;

* Role: Partner Project Manager / SI Solution Architect / Lead developers
* Organisation: eGov partner
* Responsibilities: Lead deployment of DIGIT-based modules across multiple ULBs or states
* Digital: Fluent with configuration platforms, form engines, low-code tools, Git, Jira

#### Phase 1 Outputs

The near-term vision for DIGIT Studio (earlier called Solution Framework) is a low-code accelerator on DIGIT 2.9 LTS that enables rapid deployment of configurable apps, helping eGov partners quickly launch systems.

We’re piloting DIGIT Studio with the Local Business License Issuing System, making licensing workflow deployment faster.

### Problem Statement

Currently, multiple independent services and UIs are built separately for similar use cases, leading to:

❌ Duplicated Efforts – Teams rebuild similar services instead of reusing existing ones.\
❌ Inconsistent Logic – Each service is implemented differently, making standardisation difficult.\
❌ High Maintenance Costs – Every service requires independent updates and bug fixes.\
❌ Scalability Issues – Managing multiple versions creates operational complexity.\
❌ Limited Reusability – A lack of shared components leads to inefficiencies.

### Solution Approach

To address these challenges, we propose:

* A Common Service Layer to centralise service logic.
* A Configurable UI that adapts based on service requirements.
* A Management Console for easy customisation and control.

This solution streamlines development, simplifies maintenance, and enhances scalability.

## Proposed Solution: DIGIT Service Delivery Platform

We introduce the DIGIT Service Delivery Platform built on DIGIT Core Services to improve efficiency and reduce redundancy.

### Key Components

1. **Generic Service** - Handles requests, validations, and data aggregation across modules.
2. **Application Service** - Manages workflows and business logic, extendable via configuration.
3. **Transformer Service** - Processes and formats data for integration with other systems.
4. **Registry Service** - Stores approved applications and integrates existing records.
5. **Dynamic Module Creation -** New modules can be added via:\
   🔹 Admin Console – UI-based module creation.\
   🔹 Configuration – Enables modules without code changes.

### Benefits

✅ Simplifies frontend interactions by centralising logic.\
✅ Reduces redundancy & maintenance through reuse.\
✅ Supports rapid module deployment via configuration.\
✅ Ensures consistent data flow across services.

This approach makes development faster, scalable, and easier to maintain.\
