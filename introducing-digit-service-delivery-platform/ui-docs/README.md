# UI Docs

The **User Interface (UI) Documentation** provides a detailed overview of how different screens, components, and workflows function within the application.\
It describes the purpose of each interface, the flow between pages, and how users interact with various elements.\
UI Docs help maintain alignment between designers, developers, and testers by clearly outlining layout behavior, data bindings, localisation usage, and integrated APIs.\
They serve as a single source of truth for understanding how the system’s front-end is structured and how each module contributes to the overall user experience.
