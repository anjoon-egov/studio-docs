# Introducing DIGIT Studio

The DIGIT Studio is a unified, configuration-driven architecture designed to streamline urban governance service development, deployment, and maintenance on DIGIT 2.9 LTS.

Goals of the DIGIT Studio -

1. Reduce the time needed to build a particular use case. We will use two use cases—License and Permits and Grievance Redressal—as a reference point.
2. Reduce configuration time for a particular use case. Configuration includes changing the form fields, workflows, users and roles and adding master data.
